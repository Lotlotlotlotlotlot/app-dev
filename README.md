# The Walking Dead

A TV series about surviving the zombie apocalypse and the people you meet along the way.

## What It's About
After waking up from a coma, Rick Grimes discovers the world has been taken over by zombies. He searches for his family while trying to survive with a group of other survivors. The real danger isn't always the walkers - it's other people.

## Top 3 Characters
- **Rick Grimes** - The leader who will do anything to protect his people
- **Daryl Dixon** - The skilled tracker with a crossbow who becomes the heart of the group
- **Michonne** - A katana-wielding warrior with a mysterious past

## What Makes It Good
The show keeps you on edge because anyone can die at any time. It shows how people change when there are no more rules. Some become heroes, others become villains. The action scenes are intense and the walkers are genuinely creepy.

## Best Seasons
Seasons 1-5 are peak television. After that it has ups and downs but still worth watching if you're invested in the characters.

**My Score: 7.5/10**
