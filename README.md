A TV series about surviving the zombie apocalypse and the people you meet along the way.

## Top 3 Characters
1. **Rick Grimes** - The leader who will do anything to protect his people
2. **Daryl Dixon** - The skilled tracker with a crossbow who becomes the heart of the group
3. **Michonne** - A katana-wielding warrior with a mysterious past

## What Makes It Good
- The show keeps you on edge because anyone can die at any time
- It shows how people change when there are no more rules
- Some become heroes, others become villains
- The action scenes are intense and the walkers are genuinely creepy

> "In this life now, you kill or you die. Or you die and you kill."

### Best Seasons
Seasons 1-5 are peak television. After that it has ups and downs but still worth watching if you're invested in the characters.

**My Score: 8.5/10**
